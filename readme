Controls:
te is a modeless editor which utilizes modifier keys to perform actions.
Unlike Emacs, however, the main modifier key is the alt-key. This makes most
actions far more ergonomic compared to Emacs.
The movement keys are inspired by vi, but with a couple tweaks.

In the following key descriptions, prefixing a key with 'A-' means holding the
alt key while pressing the subsequent key. As an example, A-j refers to holding
alt and pressing the letter 'j'.
Prefixing a key with 'C-' refers to holding the control key, and 'S-' refers to
the shift key.

To move
 - left:  A-j
 - down:  A-k
 - up:    A-l
 - right: A-;
This is superior to vi's movement keys because it keeps the right hand in the
standard touch-typing position, as opposed to one key too far to the left.

To delete
 - character in front of cursor: A-d

To exit: A-q (subject to change)

More description of controls will be added here as they are added.
